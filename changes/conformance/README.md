# Conformance Changes

Please create changelog fragments in this directory for changes that affect the
conformance tests (including the conformance layer). These fragments will be
included in only the conformance changelogs.

See the README.md in the parent directory for information on the format and
naming of changelog fragment files.

Each entry should be prefixed with one of the following:

- "New test:"
- "Fix:"
- "Improvement:"
