# Changelog for OpenXR-CTS Repo

Update log for the OpenXR-CTS repo on GitHub. Updates are
in reverse chronological order starting with the latest public release.

This summarizes the periodic public releases, not individual commits. Releases
on GitHub are generally done as single large patches at the release point,
collecting together the resolution of many Khronos internal issues, along with
any public pull requests that have been accepted. In this repository in
particular, since it is primarily software, pull requests may be integrated as
they are accepted even between periodic updates.
